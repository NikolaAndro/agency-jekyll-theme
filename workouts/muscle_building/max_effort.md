description: This is a very intense workout for muscle building. 5-6 workouts a week. About 1.5 h per workout on average. <br><br><b>Specifics:</b> <br><br> <b>Drop set</b> - usually done after the last set. If it is a double drop set, you will lower the weight for 10% and perform the exercise until failure, then drop weight for another 10% and perform until failure. <br><br> <b>Blood Restriction</b> - use a band and tigh it at the beginning of your arm or leg (depending on what the restriction is for), then perform the exercise. <br><br> <b>Intra-set stretching</b> - When doing biceps, you will extend your elbows and just hold the weight. If it is being aplied to calves, then you will hold your calves stretched below the step level. <br><br> <b>Rest and Pause</b> - after performing all the reps, put the weight down, rest for 15 sec. and pump as much more as you can. <br><br> <b>Rest Days</b> - feel free to do some more exercises on what you feel you did not hit enough. Some running, yoga, or any other activity would be great. On Sundays, give your body a full day of rest with propper nutrition.
