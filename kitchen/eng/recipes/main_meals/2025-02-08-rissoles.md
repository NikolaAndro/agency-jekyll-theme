        **Instructions**

        1. Add the minced beef, onion, minced garlic, egg, breadcrumbs, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, pepper and salt or stock powder to a large mixing bowl. Use your hands to combine and roll the mixture into portions the size of golf balls. Flatten using the palm of your hand to form the rissoles.
        
        2. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan over medium–low heat. Cook the rissoles for 8–10 minutes until browned and cooked through, turning once halfway through. Cook in batches if you need to, so that the pan isn’t crowded – this will prevent the rissoles steaming in the pan and will ensure a golden crust. Set the rissoles aside on a plate.

        3. This step is optional. Turn the heat off. Drain any excess oil from the bottom of the pan using a serving spoon and then, while the pan is still hot, add 2–3 tablespoons of water. Use a spoon to scrape up all of the pan drippings. Drizzle the pan juices over the rissoles and serve with your favourite sides.
        
        
        **Air Fryer Instructions** 
        
        1. Preheat your air fryer to 180°C (350°F) for about 3–5 minutes. 
        
        2. Lightly spray or brush both sides of the rissoles with olive oil to ensure they brown evenly. 
        
        3. Place the rissoles in a single layer in the air fryer basket, ensuring they are not touching. 
        
        4. Cook in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding. Air fry the rissoles for 10–12 minutes, flipping them halfway through the cooking time. Quick note when air frying: must be made with regular minced (ground) beef, not lean as it’s too dry!
